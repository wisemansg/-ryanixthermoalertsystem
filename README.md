# 🔥 Ryanix ThermoAlert System 

**Automated Critical Machine Monitoring & Multi-Channel Emergency Response Workflow**

The Ryanix ThermoAlert System is an automated workflow designed to monitor machine telemetry and respond to critical alerts, such as high temperatures. This system integrates AI-driven decision-making with multiple notification channels to ensure rapid response and prevent potential failures in industrial equipment. The name of the imaginary company is Ryanix Solutions.

## 🌟 Summary

This workflow activates on a scheduled trigger to check machine telemetry data, such as temperature and status. Upon detecting a critical condition (for example, 92°C on Machine ACME-01), it executes a series of actions:

- Sending professional email alerts via Gmail
- Scheduling urgent repairs in Google Calendar
- Dispatching push notifications through Telegram
- Creating high-priority incidents in PagerDuty
- Broadcasting team updates on Discord

An AI agent powered by OpenAI processes the telemetry and coordinates these tasks, with simple memory to retain context for ongoing monitoring.

## 👥 Intended Users

- Industrial maintenance teams that require immediate notifications for equipment issues
- Operations managers overseeing machinery in manufacturing or data centers
- IT administrators building automated alert systems for hardware monitoring

## ⚙️ Functionality and Operation

### ⏰ Trigger Activation  
A schedule trigger initiates the workflow at set intervals to review current machine telemetry (e.g., Machine ID: ACME-01, Temperature: 92°C, Status: Critical).

### 🤖 AI Processing  
The OpenAI Chat Model analyzes the telemetry data and generates tailored responses for each notification channel.

### 📧 Gmail Notification  
A formal email is sent to the manager, featuring:

- A proper salutation
- Structured paragraphs
- A section titled 'Immediate Actions Required' with five bulleted steps, such as emergency stop, cooling activation, and isolation procedures

### 🗓️ Google Calendar Scheduling  
An event is created with details including:

- **Title**: URGENT: Emergency Repair - Machine ACME-01
- **Description**: Critical temperature alert (92°C) detected. Maintenance required to prevent system failure.
- **Location**: Grünerløkka, Oslo, Norway

### 🔥 PagerDuty Incident Creation  
A high-priority incident is logged with:

- **Title**: [CRITICAL] ACME-01 Overheat (92°C)
- **Description**: Industrial telemetry indicates a critical temperature threshold has been exceeded.
- **Urgency**: High

### 🧠 Memory Management  
Simple Memory stores recent telemetry context to support follow-up actions in subsequent runs.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🚀 n8n Deployment  
Install n8n on a self-hosted server or through a cloud service like Coolify or Docker.

### 🔑 Credential Configuration  
Set up the following credentials in n8n:

- OAuth2 credentials for Gmail and Google Calendar via Google Cloud Console
- API keys for OpenAI, Telegram, PagerDuty, and Discord in the n8n credentials section

### 📥 Workflow Import  
In the n8n interface:

- Navigate to Workflows
- Select Import
- Insert the workflow JSON configuration
- Verify that all credential references align with the established IDs for Gmail, OpenAI, and other services

### 🧪 Testing Procedure  
- Activate the workflow manually or simulate telemetry data
- Observe logs to confirm notifications across channels and incident creation
